# Data-Science-

This project is a compilation of all my work using different data sets to analyze aspects of the real-world. Can we see trends amongst 
day to day events and come up with predictive analytics? 

Each file is either in .docx form or .txt form. I have added the code segments in between the questions that I have asked to come up with different analysis solutions. The name of the file will give insights into the different analysis that I did. 

I used primarly, R Programming, SQL, and Python to do my analysis.
